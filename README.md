# MathUtils
This library currently includes:
 * **Arbitrary Precision BigDecimal Functions** - Allows for the calculation of all the basic trigonometric functions to several hundred digits of accuracy.
 * **NxM Matrices** - Allows for creation of NxM matrices that can be used for mathematical calculations or even for vector (vertex) manipulations. Especially useful for things like OpenGL development.
 * **2D and 3D Vertex (Vector) Classes** - Allows representation of 2D or 3D vectors or vertices to be used for physics or graphical applications.
 * **Logic Expression Prover using Natural Deduction** - Fancy way of saying the ability to prove a conclusion formula given some logical formulae (premises). Currently not quite functional but works with simpler logical formulae.
 * **Symbolic Mathematical Expression Solver** - Can simplify expressions producing exact results and can (eventually) solve equations for specific variables. One possible addition may include differential equations.
 * **Adaptable Expression Parser** - Flexible expression parser that will be able to produce an expression from a string input, providing the ability for a user to enter in expressions in a more natural way.
