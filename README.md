# MathUtils
This library currently includes:
 * **Arbitrary Precision BigDecimal Functions** - Allows for the calculation of all the basic trigonometric functions to several hundred digits of accuracy.
 * **NxM Matrices** - Allows for creation of NxM matrices that can be used for mathematical calculations or even for vector (vertex) manipulations. Especially useful for things like OpenGL development.
 * **2D and 3D Vertex (Vector) Classes** - Allows representation of 2D or 3D vectors or vertices to be used for physics or graphical applications.
 
With some code refactoring and merging, this library will eventually include:

 * **Logic Expression Prover using Natural Deduction** - Fancy way of saying the ability to prove a conclusion formula given some logical formulae (premises).
 
Stuff I'm planning on adding:

 * **Mathematical Expression Prover using Natural Deduction** - Same thing but can solve simple math formulas.
